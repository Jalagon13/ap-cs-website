            <p>I am a student at Benicia High School. I have lived here my entire life and I love this school district. My hobbies are weight training and videogames. 
                My bench currently is 195. Deadlift is 250. Power clean is 105. Rank in League of Legends currently is Diamond 5. My favorite food is chicken salad sandwiches.
                I love the horror genre. I listen to creepypastas every night and I'm currently reading a japanese horror novel.
